The beauty of nature has attracted people to it’s very own shelter, these days the border’s of the map don’t matter. From exploring the wilderness of the amazon rainforest to those romantic getaways in maldives, people have explored it all.

From lush green land to deserted land, small homes to big monuments, variety of people to various species, this globe has a plethora of spots to visit. Travel is a way to explore the beauty of this world. These days travel has become a hobby to most of the people across the globe. With the great network that we have in the present world it is almost possible to feel each and every corner of the world. Everyday, billions of people travel for various purposes. It has become so important in the present generation as many people are benefited from it.

Travel has lots of benefits and it has its own beauty. It is a path to gain knowledge about new places, new people, new culture, new language and what not. In recent days travel has moved one step ahead. It is playing a major role in the economy of a country. It contributes a lot to the local people by using their facilities and it could also contribute to one's day to day needs also. 
But now comes the interesting question, Will all this change after the covid-19 situation is over?

Probably yes, Countries have badly been affected by Covid-19 they have been under lockdown for a over a long period of time to tackle the situation.But how does that change travel ? 

People would be  more careful than ever, they would like good healthcare facilities  for if something goes wrong, but that’s not all there will be, more scrutiny when crossing the borders , countries will be more cautious about people entering their premises. This pandemic will leave its share of scars in the mind of people.
How will this sector make a comeback is a big question mark?

One  point to be considered would be that people have been under lockdown and are wanting to get out, will that boost the travel sector? Would people prefer across boundary travel or would they go for in house travel? All these questions can only be answered by time to come, but in the following paragraphs we offer insights on how the travel industry would recover.
It will take quite a number of  days for the travel industry to gain back the rhythm that they had before. It is only after the release of lockdown this industry can resume its operation. In the meanwhile, it's very much important for them to bring about new strategies to make into the market as early as possible. All the companies in this industry will have a tough competition among each other as everyone`s aim would be the same that is to hit the market! It is high time for them to think about making profit and maintaining the quality of their service and look after the well being of their employees too.
 Nonetheless, it's pretty sure that this industry will have the consumers as much as it had before because the number of people travelling would not reduce. They might face some challenges in the initial stages but they can come with a boom soon when compared to the other industries. But it is the competition that is going to be a challenge to companies that come under this industry. It's going to be very competitive for them to grab the attention of the market and they can get it by providing some irresistible offers.
